#### አጭር የዴክላሬሽን  ኦፕሬተር ( ፡= )

* The short declaration variable := 
    * used to assign a value to a variable. (ለተባራይ ዋጋ ለመስጠት)
    * You can only use the short declaration inside of a code block. (በ “{}” ውስጥ ብቻ ነው የምንጠቀምበት)
* Keywords (ቁልፍ ቃላት) : 
    * Reserved words (የተያዙ ቃላት)
    * Words that the programming language uses, and cannot be used as variable names (የፕሮግራሚንግ ቋንቋው ብቻ የሚጠቀምባቸው)

#### Programming terminology (የፕሮግራሚንግ ቃላት)

* Operators (*ከንዋኝ)
    * combine operands into expressions (ተክንውኞችን በማጣመር ወደ ኤክስፕረሽን ይቀይራሉ)
    * := is one of the operators
    * https://golang.org/ref/spec#Operators_and_punctuation
    * in “2 + 2” the “+” is the operators
    * character that represents an action, as for example “+” is an arithmetic OPERATOR that represents addition (ስሌታዊ ድርጊትን ያመለክታሉ)

* Operand (*ተከንዋኝ)
    * in “2 + 2” the “2”s are OPERANDS (ስሌታዊ ድርጊት የሚፈጸምባቸው)

* Statement (“ስንኝ”)
    * In programming a statement is the smallest standalone element of a program that expresses some action to be carried out.
    * A program is formed by a sequence of one or more statements.

* Expression (“አባባል”)
    * combination of one or more explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value. For example, 2+3 is an expression which evaluates to 5.

* ዋና መልእት 
    * “short declaration operator, := which is a common way to assign a value to a variable. You can only use it inside a code block (inside curly braces {}).”
