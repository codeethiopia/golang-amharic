#### የ አይነት(Type) ቅኝት (Exploring Type)

Once we *DECLARE* a *VARIABLE* is of a certain *TYPE* it can only hold *VALUES* of that *TYPE* (*ተባራይ* *ከታወጀ* በኋላ *አይነቱ* የጸና ነው ፤ የሚይዘውም *ዋጋ* የዚህ *አይነት* ነው!)

* Go is statically typed (የ ጎ አይነቶች ተቀያያሪ አደሉም )
    * var z int = 21

* *primitive data types*: In computer science, primitive data type is either of the following:
    * *a basic type* : is a data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block. Most languages allow more complicated composite types to be recursively constructed starting from basic types.
    * *a built-in type*: is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support.In most programming languages, all basic data types are built-in. In addition, many languages also provide a set of composite data types. Opinions vary as to whether a built-in type that is not basic should be considered "primitive".

* *composite data types*:
    * In computer science, a *composite data type* or *compound data type* is any data type which can be constructed in a program using the programming language's primitive data types and other composite types. It is sometimes called a *structure* or *aggregate data type*, although the latter term may also refer to arrays, lists, etc. *The act of constructing a composite type is known as composition*
